# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)

## Overview

This branch is focused on the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to solve a binary classification problem on Remote Sensing (RS). 

The dataset used is the [Volume de Represas de São Paulo](https://www.kaggle.com/cerranet/volume-de-represas-de-so-paulo) from Kaggle. The dataset contains 2,000 images of 256x256 pixels, divided into two classes: 1) reservoirs with low water volume and 2) reservoirs with high water volume.

This model is part of a couple of conclusion projects for the Deep Learning course from Master's degree in Computer Science at Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP).
