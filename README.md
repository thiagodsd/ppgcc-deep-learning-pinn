# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)

## Overview

This repository is structured into two main branches:

- `main`: Contains materials related to our seminar studies on PINNs. We studied four systems:
    1. [Damped Harmonic Oscillators](notebooks/damped_harmonic_oscillator.ipynb)
    2. [Driven Harmonic Oscillators](notebooks/driven_harmonic_oscillator.ipynb)
    3. [Newton's Law of Cooling](notebooks/newton_law_cooling.ipynb)
    4. [Burgers' Equation](notebooks/bateman_burgers_equation.ipynb)
  
- `paper`: Under development, but this branch is focused on present our experiments in a scientific paper format.
