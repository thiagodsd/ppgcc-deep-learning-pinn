# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)

## Overview

This branch is focused on the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to solve a binary classification problem on Remote Sensing (RS). 

The dataset used is the [Trees in Satellite Imagery](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcagriaksoy/trees-in-satellite-imagery) dataset, which contains 10,000 images of 64x64 pixels, divided into two classes: trees and non-trees. The dataset is divided into 8,000 images for training and 2,000 images for testing. The images are RGB, with 3 channels, and the labels are binary, with 0 for non-trees and 1 for trees.

This model is part of a couple of conclusion projects for the Deep Learning course from Master's degree in Computer Science at Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP).
